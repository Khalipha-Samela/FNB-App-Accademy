            <h3>Earth's Mightiest Heroes</h3>
            <p>
              The Avengers are a team of extraordinary individuals with
              superhuman abilities who come together to protect Earth from
              threats too large for any one hero to handle. Originally conceived
              by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, the Avengers Initiative brings
              together the world's most powerful heroes to form an unparalleled
              defense force.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              When danger threatens the world, the Avengers assemble to combat
              forces that no single hero could withstand. From alien invasions
              to global catastrophes to super-villain alliances, we stand as
              Earth's first and last line of defense.
            </p>
            <h3>Avengers Assemble</h3>
            <p>
              The team's famous battle cry "Avengers Assemble!" has become a
              rallying call for heroes across the universe. Though membership
              has changed over time, our core mission remains the same: to fight
              the battles that humanity cannot fight alone.
